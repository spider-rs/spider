# Contributing to Spider

:+1::tada: Thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Spider project. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Contributions are welcome and will be fully credited!

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/{{ githubAccount }}/{{ name }}).

## Pull Requests

Here are some guidelines to make the process smoother:

- **Add a test** - New features and bugfixes need tests. If you find it difficult to test, please tell us in the pull request and we will try to help you!
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Run `cargo test` locally** - This will allow you to go faster
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure your commits message means something
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

## Creating issues

### Bug reports

Always try to provide as much information as possible. If you are reporting a bug, try to provide a repro on jsfiddle.net (or anything else) or a stacktrace at the very least. This will help us check the problem quicker.

### Feature requests

Lay out the reasoning behind it and propose an API for it. Ideally, you should have a practical example to prove the utility of the feature you're requesting.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by github code of conduct guidelines.
